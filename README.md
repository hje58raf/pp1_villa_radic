# Villa Radic Website

[Villa Radic Website](https://hje58raf.github.io/pp1_villa_radic)  is part of Code Institute's Portfolio Project 1 - HTML/CSS Essentials. It is intended for tourists who want to discover new destinations hidden in the interior of Croatia. It was started at the persuasion of my cousin Zeljko Radic, the owner of the cottage, who wants to create a quality website for renting.

# UX

## Project goals

* Making a static front-end site to present useful information to users/ guest, using all technologies that I have learned about so far. (HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and user experience/design)
* Creating a website that is easy to navigate and easy to understand.
* The customer experience has to be great on every device and internet browser.
* I am creating the Holiday cottage website in order to show guests all the beauty, comfort and quality of the accommodation.
* The Holiday cottage website is intended for guests who want to spend their vacation away from the city bustle, in untouched nature.

## User stories

### First time visitors

* As a first-time visitor, I want the website to scale on every device so that I can look at the website on desktop, mobile and tablet.
* As a first-time visitor, I want to know which projects the person has done so that I know the level of experience of the person.
* As a first-time visitor, to the site I want the information to be clear and concise so that I can easily understand what the site is about. 
* As a first-time visitor, I want to being able to find all the information that is available and the facility to check out their social media for any other useful information.

### As a guest

* I simply want to check if the accommodation meets my requirements.
* I will need to have a quick and easy way to contact the owner if he meets the required criteria.

## Design

I've chosen 2 primary colours for the backgrounds (#fdebe4), headings and footers (#d1e3fa). I tried to match the colors on the website with the colors used in the cottage image

## Typography

The Lato and Roboto font is the main fonts used throughout the whole portfolio website. Sans Serif is the fallback in case the main font isn’t being imported to the site correctly. 

## Imagery

All images are All images are taken from https://www.novasol.com/. All pictures are personal pictures of the owner of the cottage, Željko Radić, who is my relative and who gave me permission to use them in this project. I tried to match the colors on the website with the colors used in the Maoxchan image.

## Features Left To Implement In The Future

* As this project is designed to build a static front-end that demonstrates the skills I have developed using CSS3, HTML5 and Bootstrap technologies, I would add the possibility of reservation, reviews and Google map in the next projects.

## Browser compatibility

* I tested the appearance  and responsiveness of 4 browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Opera and Edge) and it showed good results in all browsers.

## Test the Navigation Bar between Desktop and Mobile

* Test the navigation bar collapses to give the 'hamburger' icon when the device is smaller than medium.

## Test the Footer

* I placed the social media icons in the center of the footer. I tested all the links and they all worked well. The social media links each open in a separate tab.

## Navigation Testing

* The menu options all open the correct page except for of the 'CV Download' which opens my CV in a separate tab.


## Contact Page

* When testing a page, the Name and Description fields allow input of any text while Email requires the input of Email form. I repeated the test several times and each time it was successful.

## Deployment


### The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy are as follows: 
* In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab 
* From the source section drop-down menu, select the Master Branch
* Once the master branch has been selected, the page will be automatically refreshed with a detailed ribbon display to indicate the successful deployment.

# Credits

## Content

* Most of the code was developed by the use of Bootstrap's library and w3schools throughout the project to ensure the responsiveness of the website such as the Navbar, The Main Image and Gallery. I also found some inspiration in two Code Institute projects: Love Running and Mini project with Bootstrap 4.

## Media

All pictures are personal pictures of the owner of the cottage, Željko Radić, who is my cousin and who gave me permission to use them in this project.

I would like to thank:
* My mentor, Rahul Lakhanpal, for his guidance, patience and encouragement throughout this project.
* The slack community for its extensive Q&A, I found most of the answers to my problems there.
* Thanks to everyone at the Code Institute for helping to make this such an enjoyable and rewarding experience.
